11/10    5:00pm          2:00       Read assignment and tried to understand the spec fully. Later on looked at the starter code and went though it. Quickly went through the kdtrees slides from lecture
11/11    8:00pm          3:00       Implemented my kdtree.c partially. Made my makefile as well to test the unit test cases as I went by.
11/12    4:00pm          3:00       completed implementation of the remaining functions in kdtree.c
11/14    6:00pm          3:00       Tried debugging my remove function but was not able to spot the problem. Got help with it at threeathon. After which I was done.

DISCUSSION

The challenging aspect of the assignment was efficiently managing the kdtree's recursive structure. It jogged my recursion abilities a bit.
Initially it was a bit challenging using cut dimensions since they alternated and I had to figure out a way around them. I misunderstood how 
the depth and cutting dimensions were related when re-calling the remove function, which caused mismatches  and logical errors when 
replacing nodes with their minimum or maximum subtree values. 
Debugging the unit tests was also challenging. Specifically, Unit Tests 13 and 14 revealed that I was inadvertently losing references to 
some points during node removal. Turned out I was not handling the remove cases where the node has one child well. This required restructuring 
the remove logic to ensure promoted nodes retained correct relationships and cutting dimensions.
Despite these struggles, the assignment deepened my understanding of recursive tree structures, efficient range queries, 
and dynamic memory management. Each debug session taught me valuable lessons about edge cases and the importance of thorough testing.
